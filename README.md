Tools to aid with my third year project
=======================================

My project is an algorithm for computing similar nodes in _large_ graphs.
This repository contains tools that I need to process different datasets into a simple
CSV format. For now it's just (nodeId, nodeId) pairs.

The tools will have their own readme file and each be in a different folder.

Note: the tools that start with "s\_" are specific code for a dataset I'm playing with.

Experiments
-----------

In `sim/` and `matrix_exp/` there are experiments with Go matrix libraries, and with linking Go to Matlab code. This was part of the process of choosing what language to port the algorithm in (from Matlab) so it can be developed further.

Licence
=======

All the tools are licenced under the MIT Licence (see LICENCE).
