Tools to aid with my third year project
=======================================

My project is an algorithm for computing similar nodes in _large_ graphs.
This repository contains tools that I need to process different datasets into a simple
CSV format. For now it's just (nodeId, nodeId) pairs.

The tools will have their own readme file and each be in a different folder.

Note: the tools that start with "s\_" are specific code for a dataset I'm playing with.

Licence
=======

All the tools are licenced under the MIT Licence (see LICENCE).
